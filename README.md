## Overview of the Project

Introducing the Weather App, a sleek and modern application designed to provide users with real-time weather updates and hourly forecasts. This user-friendly application allows users to quickly search for their city and receive detailed weather information, including temperature, weather conditions, and an icon representing the current weather. With an aesthetically pleasing design and responsive interface, the Weather App ensures a seamless user experience.

## Key Features

- *Real-time Weather Updates:* Get instant weather information for any city, including temperature, weather conditions, and a descriptive icon.
- *Hourly Forecasts:* View the weather forecast for the next 24 hours with a detailed breakdown every three hours, including temperature and weather conditions.
- *Responsive Design:* The app is optimized for all devices, ensuring a consistent and enjoyable user experience on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
- *Modern UI/UX:* The application features a vibrant, gradient background with a semi-transparent weather container, creating a visually appealing and modern look. The neon glow animation adds a touch of elegance to the overall design.
- *Error Handling:* Proper error handling ensures that users are informed in case of any issues with fetching weather data.

## API Used

The Weather App leverages the *OpenWeatherMap API* to fetch real-time weather data and hourly forecasts. The API provides reliable and accurate weather information, making it an ideal choice for this project. Here are the key endpoints used:

- *Current Weather Data:* https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city}&appid={apiKey}
- *Hourly Forecast Data:* https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?q={city}&appid={apiKey}

## Technologies Used

- *HTML5 & CSS3:* For the structure and styling of the application, ensuring a modern and responsive design.
- *JavaScript:* For fetching data from the OpenWeatherMap API and dynamically updating the UI with the weather information.
- *OpenWeatherMap API:* For accessing real-time weather data and forecasts.

## How it Works

1. *User Input:* The user enters the name of the city in the input field and clicks the "Search" button.
2. *API Request:* The application makes a request to the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the current weather data and hourly forecast for the entered city.
3. *Data Processing:* The received data is processed and displayed in the UI. The current weather section shows the temperature, weather description, and an icon, while the hourly forecast section provides a detailed forecast for the next 24 hours.
4. *Error Handling:* If there's an issue fetching the data, the user is alerted with an appropriate message.

This Weather App project not only demonstrates proficiency in front-end development but also showcases the ability to integrate third-party APIs to enhance functionality.

Feel free to explore the project and get real-time weather updates for your city!
